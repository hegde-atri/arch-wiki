# Some packages that I use

These are some packages that I use day to day.

## Multimedia

### mpv + svp

Mpv is a free and opensource media player. SVP(Smooth video project) is a real time video frame rate converter(Converts any video into 60 fps). If you do not want SVP and only want mpv, you can install VLC media player.

### VLC media player

Simple, easy to use media player. Install using `yay -S vlc`.

## Game-related

I use Steam, and lutris to play most my games.
`yay -S lutris steam`
