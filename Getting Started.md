# Getting Started

Some of the tools that you will want. I might have used these tools in the other pages.

## Using a package manager/AUR helper

is the AUR? It is the Arch User repository. Contaning packages made and maintained by the users. My personal preference of package manager is yay. Install [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay).

```sh
pacman -S --needed git base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

## Changing your terminal and shell

I like to use the kitty terminal with the fish shell. You might want to stick with bash or use zsh.
