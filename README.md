## If you are new to Arch

I would personally not recommend arch as a starting distro; However, if you have a friend who is well versed in arch and is willing to help you through the installation a few times to the point where you are able to do it yourself, it is worth living through the installation pain and sticking with arch.

If you decide that arch is not for you since it can be daunting, I would recommend any distro with KDE Plasma as its desktop environment. Ex: Kubuntu.
