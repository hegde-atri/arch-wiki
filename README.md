# archlinux-help-sheet

Guide is going over some major reworking as I have a much deeper understanding of arch linux, but also noticed quite a few typos.
Updating the page will take some time due to me having a busy schedule!

Guide will now be hosted using github pages [here](https://hegde-atri.github.io/archlinux-help-sheet/),
