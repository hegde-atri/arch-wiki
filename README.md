# Archlinux wiki

This wiki is a cumulation of some helpful things I learnt whilst using Arch.

I also have a snippets chapter, full of little hacks that were hard to find.

## Installing Archlinux

Install using the [official arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/). You should
make an installer for yourself if you find yourself reinstalling your system
every now and again.
You can check out my installer on GitHub at [hegde-atri/arch-install](https://github.com/hegde-atri/arch-install).
