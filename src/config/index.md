# Config Folder

In your home directory, located `/home/<username>`, or simply `~`, you will find
a directory `~/.config`. Directories prefixed with `.` are hidden by default
so you will need to view it using `ls -la` (`-a` is the all flag).

In this directory lives all the configuration of installed applications. For example
your `neovim` configuration will be in `~/.config/neovim`.

If you are using a TWM, you usually put you configuration in here.

These are usually called [dotfiles](../dotfiles.md).
