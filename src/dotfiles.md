# Dotfiles

You should save your configuration in a folder, preferrably a git repository.
This way you do not have to spend any time configuring your applications, you
can just copy this configuration into any machine your are using.

You can check out my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/hegde-atri/dotfiles).
