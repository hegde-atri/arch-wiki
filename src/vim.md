# Vim

Vim - Vi iMproved is a text editor that uses keystrokes to control everything! You do not need your
mouse whatsoever. This keystrokes are often called `vim motions`. Vim motions are so effecient, that
most text-editors or IDE's have a Vim extension of some sort.

To learn how to use vim:
- Install `vim` package.
- Type `:VimTutor`

As much as I do love the intention behind vim, I cannot learn vim script, so I use Neovim instead.

# Neovim

[Neovim](https://neovim.io) is an opensource application that is basically vim, but extensible using the Lua programming
language. (Neovim is an amazing project and a lot of work has been done to refector it!)

To try neovim, install the `neovim` package.
