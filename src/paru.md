# AUR helper

AUR Helper, is simple a program that helps manage packages for us rather than pacman.
This is because
- `pacman` can be very confusing in the beginning.
- we cannot install AUR (Arch User Repository) packages using `pacman`.

## What is the AUR



## Paru

Paru is my AUR helper of choice. It is very fast and feature rich. To see some configuration options
visit the [paru page](./apps/paru.html).
