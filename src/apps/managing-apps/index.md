# Managing applications
## Different ways of installing applications

What you would refer to as an application, is called a package on linux. There are multiple ways
to install a package and multiple formats they come in. Usually you will be installing the
packges from you package manager, which in our case is `pacman`.

However sometimes this isn't the best solution due to various reasons.
- You do not want to upgrade from the current version, but instead want both versions
- Dependency breaking
- You want to install an older version which isn't possible by `pacman`.
