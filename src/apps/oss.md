# Open Source Alternatives

Instead of using proprietary applications, how about you try some of these applications.

## OSS Clients for Proprietary applications

- Webcord is a Open source client for discord. Install the binary version using
the command `paru -S webcord-bin`

## FOSS  applications

- Using `code`, instead of `visual-studio-code-bin`. Code is the open source version that vscode is base on. However you will need to use the Open VSIX registry to install
extensions rather than vscode marketplace. You can still install extensions from the
vscode marketplace by downloading the `.vsix` file.

- Using `logseq-desktop-bin` as an app for note-taking. Inspired from org-mode and 
roam-research. An amazing tool for note taking, learn more on their
[website](https://logseq.com/).

- Using `insomnia-bin`, instead of `postman-bin`. Insomnia is an API client and Design
platform for GraphQL and REST.

- You should definitely be using `firefox` over any other browser. It offers the best
customization and is much better than chrome.
