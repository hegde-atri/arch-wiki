# Windows apps

You can run windows executables through a emulation layer called `wine`. The best way to do this
is using a flatpak application called [Bottles](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.usebottles.bottles), which is available on FlatHub.

If however you want software such as MS Office or Adobe applications, you will be better of using
[winapps](https://github.com/Fmstrat/winapps). (Looking for maintainers as of 28/09/2021)
