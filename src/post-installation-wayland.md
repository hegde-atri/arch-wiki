# Wayland

Wayland is the new display server protocol being developed as an alternative (and hoping to
replace) X11/Xorg. Due to it being a fairly new protocol, it hasn't had time to mature, and
cannot do everything perfectly just yet, however it is perfectly daily drivable!.

Here are some packages that you will need if you are using a wayland/wlroots based compositor.
- `swaylock`: a simple screen lock.
- `wlogout`: a simple logout menu.
- `wofi`: wayland version of rofi, an applications launcher.
- `wl-clipboard`: clipboard functionality like xclip.
- `mako`: notification daemon.
