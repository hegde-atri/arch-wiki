# Wayland

```admonish info
Wayland is the new display server protocol being developed as an alternative (and hoping to
replace) X11/Xorg.
```

Here are some packages that you will need if you are using a wayland/wlroots based compositor.

- `swaylock`: a simple screen lock.
- `wlogout`: a simple logout menu.
- `wofi`: wayland version of rofi, an applications launcher.
- `wl-clipboard`: clipboard functionality like xclip.
- `mako`: notification daemon.

## Hyprland

This is my WM (Window Manager) of choice on wayland.
